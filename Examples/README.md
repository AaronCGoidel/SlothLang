# SlothLang Examples

These are some example programs demonstrating how Sloth works.

All of these are run in SlothLang's extensive test suite--each program is interpreted, and if it crashes horrendusly, the tests fail.


## HelloWorld

This prints `Hello, World!`. 

## Count

This prints all the natural numbers from 1 to 10. It then returns 11.
